Temperature dependence of Josephson junction critical current based on KO-I and KO-II equations 
==============

Named after the British physicist Brian Josephson [1], Josephson junctions are a subset of weak links; a family of structures that display the Josephson effect. Such structures have an important application in voltage standards [2], quantum-mechanical circuits, such as Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) [3], superconducting qubits [4], and RSFQ digital electronics [5]. Different examples of Josephson junctions are shown in Figure below.

(a) tunnel junction, for example, S-I-S sandwich. All others are dif- ferent weak links (structures with direct non-tunnel-type conductivity): (b) sandwich, (c) proximity effect bridge, (d) ion implanted bridge, (e) Dayem bridge, (f) variable thickness bridge, (g) point contact, (h) blob type junction. S = Superconducting, S’ = superconducting with reduced critical parameters, SE = semiconductor (usually highly doped), N = normal metal and I = Insulator. Adapted from Likharev [6]">

To understand the unique and important features of Josephson junctions, it's first necessary to understand the basic concepts and features of superconductivity. Whenever you cool many metals and alloys to very low temperatures (kelvin and millikelvin temperatures), a phase transition occurs. At this "critical temperature, (T<sub>c</sub>)" the metal goes from what is known as the normal state, where it has electrical resistance, to the superconducting state, where there is essentially no resistance to the flow of direct electrical current, the resistance returns when either the temperature is brought back above the critical temperature or the current through the device is higher than a critical current I<sub>c</sub>. As such evaluating the performance of Josephson junctions is determined by the parameters;
- Critical Temperature T<sub>c</sub>
- Operating temperature T
- Critical current I<sub>c</sub>
- Normal State Resistance R<sub>N</sub>

Hence determining the critical current of different weak links is an important step in modelling Joesphson junctions. In 1975 and 1977, Kulik and Omelyanchuk developed a set of equations that model the effect of temperature on I<sub>c</sub> of different weak links.

KO (I) and KO (II)
--------------
- The first case (denoted as (KO-I)) [2] applies to dirty or short weak links and is given as:

where &#948;, the n<sup>th</sup> Matsubara frequency &#295;&#969; and &#916; are respectively given as:

where n is a positive integer and &#916;<sub>o</sub> = 3.528k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>c</sub>. Plotting the resulting I<sub>c</sub>(&phi;)R<sub>N</sub> as a function of the phase for a typical short weak link results in Figure below, where the critical current I<sub>c</sub> is taken as the maximum value of the function.

I<sub>c</sub> is taken as the maximum value of the function.">

- The second case(KO-II) [50] applies to clean or long weak links and gives:
