Temperature dependence of Josephson junction critical current based on KO-I and KO-II equations 
==============

Named after the British physicist Brian Josephson [1], Josephson junctions are a subset of weak links; a family of structures that display the Josephson effect. Such structures have an important application in voltage standards [2], quantum-mechanical circuits, such as Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) [3], superconducting qubits [4], and RSFQ digital electronics [5]. Different examples of Josephson junctions are shown in Figure below.

(a) tunnel junction, for example, S-I-S sandwich. All others are dif- ferent weak links (structures with direct non-tunnel-type conductivity): (b) sandwich, (c) proximity effect bridge, (d) ion implanted bridge, (e) Dayem bridge, (f) variable thickness bridge, (g) point contact, (h) blob type junction. S = Superconducting, Sâ€™ = superconducting with reduced critical parameters, SE = semiconductor (usually highly doped), N = normal metal and I = Insulator. Adapted from Likharev [6]">

KO (I) 
--------------
- The first case (denoted as (KO-I)) [2] applies to dirty or short weak links and is given as:

where &#948; and the the n<sup>th</sup> Matsubara &#295;&#969; frequency are respectively given as:

n is a positive integer

Taking the maximum of the resulting plot of I<sub>s</sub>(&phi;)R<sub>N<\sub> the phase &phi; and plotting this results in the overall temerpature dependent plot for the critical current of the weak link. Plotting the resulting I<sub>s</sub>(&phi;) RN as a function of the phase for a typical short weak link results in Figure 1.15, where the critical current I<sub>c</sub> is taken as the maximum value of the function.

KO (II) 
--------------

The second case(KO-II) [50] applies to clean or long weak links and gives:
