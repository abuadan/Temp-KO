Temperature dependence of Josephson junction critical current based on KO-I and KO-II equations 
==============

Named after the British physicist Brian Josephson [1], Josephson junctions are a subset of weak links; a family of structures that display the Josephson effect. Such structures have an important application in voltage standards [2], quantum-mechanical circuits, such as Superconducting QUantum Interference De- vices (SQUIDs) [3], superconducting qubits [4], and RSFQ digital electronics [5]. Different examples of Josephson junctions are shown in Figure 1.

(a) tunnel junction, for example, S-I-S sandwich. All others are dif- ferent weak links (structures with direct non-tunnel-type conductivity): (b) sandwich, (c) proximity effect bridge, (d) ion implanted bridge, (e) Dayem bridge, (f) variable thickness bridge, (g) point contact, (h) blob type junction. S = Superconducting, Sâ€™ = superconducting with reduced critical parameters, SE = semiconductor (usually highly doped), N = normal metal and I = Insulator. Adapted from Likharev [6]")
